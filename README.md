# DS-Practicum-3 Description

In this project, we analyze a dataset obtained from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to predict diabetic outcomes (diabetic, pre-diabetic, or no diabetes) based on various health-related and social determinant features. The code follows a structured process, beginning with data preparation, including type conversion, handling missing values, and addressing outliers. We then perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing relationships between the features and target variable using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Statistical tests are conducted to determine the significance of these relationships. For machine learning, we apply multiple algorithms, such as decision trees and support vector machines, using scikit-learn. Hyperparameter tuning is done through GridSearchCV to optimize model performance. We also use data partitioning, encoding for categorical variables, and normalization for continuous features. Evaluation includes model performance analysis with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with special attention to bias in the predictions. The Python libraries used include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels. Each step is documented with appropriate comments and visualizations to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
